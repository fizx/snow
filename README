Solr is the leading open-source search engine, but it's not great at realtime updates.  Your options used to be:

1. Batch your changes every few tens of seconds.
2. Patch Solr to use Lucene "Near real time" capabilities.
3. Use Solr with Zoie, a plugin for realtime search developed by LinkedIn.

Snow provides a simple (~150 lines of code) plugin for realtime search.  Inspired by Zoie, It's several times faster than Lucene NRT.
